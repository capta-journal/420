# How High??
## Marijuana use among teens

```{vgl file=./cannabis_consumption.vgl.json}

In the last 25+ years, there had been two waves of marijuana use among high-school students.

The first wave took place in the '90s. Marijuana usage began in 1991 at a relatively low 14.7% and shot up to 25.3% in only four years, reaching an all-time peak of 26.7% by the end of the decade. That is, for half the decade, fully one in four "high" school students were high.

It's not hard to see the origin of this trend in popular culture. Cypress Hill's eponymous album came out in 1991, heavily using their music to promote recreational marijuana use. Dr. Dre's debut solo album The Chronic was released in the following year, in which the album name refers to a particularly potent strain of marijuana. These, together with other rap albums of that era, heavily promoted hip hop culture and weed smoking.

The usage of cannabis declined during the aughts, and bottomed out in 2007. Then a smaller wave arrived and peaked in 2013. As of 2017 (the last data point we have), we're back at the 2007 level, which is the lowest since 1995.

While the overall picture for cannabis consumption seemed to have moderated from the early '90s, a deeper dive into the data shows many nuances within the general trend. For example, there are interesting differences between sexes. Teen males have always been more likely to blaze up than females, but that gap has steadily closed in the last 25 years. So that by 2017 both sexes were equally likely to use marijuana. That is, the drop in marijuana usage was much more of a male phenomenon. In fact, in 2017 teenage men smoked marijuana at the lowest rate (20.0%) since 1991.

Cannabis culture also diverges between different ethnicities. Native Americans are much more likely to use marijuana while Asian Americans are much less likely. Whites, Hispanics, and African Americans have tracked each other in usage most of the time, up till about ten years ago. Except for Whites, the double hump pattern in marijuana usage are quite visible in all other ethnicities. Furthermore, while the aggregate figure shown earlier suggests that the second wave of usage earlier this decade was below the peak of late '90s, that's not true for ethnic minorities. In fact, at the peak of the second wave, more Asian Americans and Native Americans were smoking than during the first wave.

So what drove the seeming decrease in consumption in the aggregate graph? It's entirely driven by White teens' lost of interest in cannabis.
